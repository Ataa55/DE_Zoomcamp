for dbt i already installed it locally with postgres adapter,
also succesfull connect to my postgres db with dbt,
my setup completed with docker, so i should go into the dbt container
and start create profiles, projects.yml files which i did,
thr problem was with the sql scripts and sources defintion, 
working with all of this through the CLI and editor like nano is very difficult,
so i'm just done with the setup.
